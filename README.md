# Repo for Testing Python Install


## Anaconda-Navigator
Anaconda-Navigator lets you launch programs (Spyder, Jupyter) and install libraries/manage environments. It provides a single starting point for everything we'll be doing in this class.

You can find it by opening the Windows menu (PC) or Spotlight Search (Mac, hold the command key and press the spacebar). Start typing in 'Anaconda-Navigator', and it should autocomplete for you.


## Jupyter
Make sure that you can launch Jupyter  and open and run a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb). You will want to launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda-Navigator, then navigate to the location of the .ipynb file.

## Standalone .py File
Make sure you can run the helloworld.py file from the command line. In Command Prompt (PC) or Terminal (Mac), enter: 'python helloworld.py' in the command line. You will need to navigate to the location of the file before running the 'python helloworld.py' command.


## Spyder
Open Anaconda Navigator, and launch Spyder. (If you have another Python IDE, like VSCode or PyCharm installed, that's fine too.) Make sure you can open and edit the .py file in Spyder.


## Check Libraries
Open the Jupyter Notebook, 'test_installed_libraries.ipynb', and run the cells one by one. All should run without errors (except the example error). You will probably need to install the plotly library (directions in the notebook).
